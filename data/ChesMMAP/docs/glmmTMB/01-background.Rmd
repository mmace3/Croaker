# Background


ChesMAPP is a fisheries independent survey conducted in the mainstem of the Chesapeake Bay, USA designed to collect data on fisheries species to support stock assessments [@Latouretal2023]. This survey uses a large mesh bottom trawl to sample juvenile and adult fish throughout the mainstem of Chesapeake Bay (Fig. \@ref(fig:chesmmap-survey-fig)). ChesMMAP started in 2002 and major modifications were made in 2018, which included the use of a new vessel, new sampling gear, and changes to the spatial and depth strata. For analyses in the current document, strata 1 and 2 for the 2002-2018 design were assigned to strata 1 of the post-2018 design, stratum 3 from the 2002-2018 was assigned to stratum 2 of the post-2018 design, and strata 4 and 5 of the 2002-2018 design were assigned to strata 3 and 4, respectively, of the post-2018 design (Fig. \@ref(fig:chesmmap-survey-fig)).
